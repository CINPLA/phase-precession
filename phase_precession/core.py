def cl_regression(x, phase, min_slope, max_slope):
    '''Determines the best linear fit to data on the surface of a cylinder

    Translated to python from Richard Kempter (October-5, 2007)
    (December-1, 2019) by Mikkel Lepper√∏d

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        real-valued vector of `linear' instances
        (e.g. places, attenuations, frequencies, etc.)
    phase : array
        vector of phases at instances x in rad (values need NOT be
       restricted to the interval [0, 2pi)
    [min_slope, max_slope]:  float
        interval of slopes in which the best_slope is determined.
        In contrast to linear regression, we MUST restrict the range of
        slopes to some `useful' range determined by prior knowledge.
         ATTENTION ! because this is a possible source of errors,
        in particular for low numbers of data points.

    Returns
    -------
    R : float
        mean resultant lenght of the residual distribution
        is a measure of the goodness of the fit
        (also called vector strength).
        Small R indicates a bad fit (worst case R=0)
        Large R indicates a good fit (best case R=1)
    slope :  float
        slope (at the maximum of R) within the interval [min_slope, max_slope]
    phi0: float
        initial phase (or phase offset) of a cyclic regression line;
        values of phi0 are always restricted to the interval [0, 2pi]
    '''
